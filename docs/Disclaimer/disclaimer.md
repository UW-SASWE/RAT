RAT {{rat_version.major}}.{{rat_version.minor}} does not represent the final word on satellite-based reservoir monitoring software development. There will undoubtedly be numerous unforeseen software hurdles or bugs that will emerge as the use of RAT {{rat_version.major}}.{{rat_version.minor}} expands. New satellite missions will emerge and many current ones may become less relevant, requiring updating of certain components of the software architecture. One such satellite mission is the recently launched Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission that will produce more accurate reservoir storage level, area and change data. Based on simulation studies reported by Bonnema and Hossain (2019), we believe SWOT will “turbocharge” the accuracy and operational efficiency of RAT {{rat_version.major}}.{{rat_version.minor}}. RAT is also purported to be hydrologic model agnostic. In its current architecture RAT {{rat_version.major}}.{{rat_version.minor}} is not yet streamlined to allow easy swapping of the hydrologic model, select specific satellites and input data streams by the user. These issues will no doubt be addressed in a future and minor upgrade of RAT {{rat_version.major}}.{{rat_version.minor}}. What is important to note is that with the wholesale overhaul of the RAT software architecture in version {{rat_version.major}}.{{rat_version.minor}}, we now have the necessary design spirit of user-friendliness, scalability, open-access and open-sharing embraced to nurture a self-sustaining community of users who can continuously improve satellite-based reservoir monitoring based on grassroots needs of users.
