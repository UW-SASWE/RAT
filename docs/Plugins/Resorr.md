# RAT-ReSORR

The ResORR plugin is a scalable, minimally parameterized model to estimate regulation of rivers due to upstream reservoir operations primarily using satellite observations of reservoir dynamcis. It is recommended to enable ResORR if there are reservoirs in the basin regulated by upstream reservoir </br></br>
Detailed description of the ResORR plugin is available at the [ResORR documentation](https://resorr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) website

## How to Use
To run the ResORR plugin, set the value of the `resorr` option in the PLUGINS section of the configuration file to `true`. If the PLUGINS section is not present in the configuration file, the user may create the section as given below

```
PLUGINS: 
	resorr: true
```

!!!Note
	Resutls generated by ResORR will be present in the folder named `Regulated` located within the `inflow` and `outflow` folders in `final_outputs`. All ancillary data generated as part of the ResORR algorithm are stored at `post_processing > resorr_network`
