# Computational Model

The RAT {{rat_version.major}}.{{rat_version.minor}} computational framework comprises 14 key steps that need to be executed successfully to complete a RAT installation run. While these steps are independent in their execution, some of them may depend on others for input. For example, outflow calculation requires the prior execution of inflow estimation through VIC and its streamflow routing. Hence, users must ensure that any omitted step has already run or that its output does not serve as input for another step. This independent execution of steps is advantageous as it eliminates the need to rerun previously executed steps during debugging or software enhancement exercises. Additionally, users have the flexibility to choose specific steps to execute, allowing them to run just individual steps, such as the surface area time series calculation instead of a complete RAT run. Given below is a list of steps shown in a table.

The workflow diagram shown below summarizes the comprehensive process employed by RAT {{rat_version.major}}.{{rat_version.minor}}, executing the 14 key steps to generate essential reservoir data, including inflow, outflow, storage change, and evaporation.

!!! tip_note "Tip"
    RAT {{rat_version.major}}.{{rat_version.minor}} has two hidden and mandatory steps named as '-1' and '0'. Step '-1' reads configuration settings to run RAT while step '0' creates the required directory structure for RAT.

!!! note
    1. From here-on, in this section, bold words represents either file names or file paths or directory paths. If just a file name is mentioned, its location will be likely in `data_dir`>`region_name`>basins>`basin_name`> and the step you are dealing with. For example if step-4 is running metsim and you are looking at its input, the exact path will be `data_dir`>`region_name`>basins>`basin_name`>metsim>metsim_inputs>metsim_input.nc.

    2. If the path or name of a file or folder contains a word enclosed in angular bracket then that means the particular word is a variable and is actually substituted by the value of the variable when the actual file/folder is created.

    3. In case of <b>&lt;dam.csv&gt;</b> the 'dam' is substituted by <b>&lt;id&gt;\_&lt;name&gt;</b> if `station_global_data` is `True`. The values of 'id' and 'name' are taken by `stations_vector_file` and all spaces in 'name' are replaced by '_'. 

    4. In case of <b>&lt;dam.csv&gt;</b> the 'dam' is substituted by <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> if `station_global_data` is `False`. The values of 'name' are taken by `station_latlon_path` (or `station_file`in Routing Parameters in configursation file) and all spaces in 'name' are replaced by '_'.

<sup class='step_heading'>Preparation of VIC Parameter File</sup> <br>
<span class='step_property'> Task: </span> Execution of VIC requires soil and domain parameter files. In case a user has not provided VIC parameter files for the basin and instead have provided parameter files of extent more than the basin, then RAT {{rat_version.major}}.{{rat_version.minor}} automatically creates the soil and domain paramter files for the basin.<br><br>

## Step-7
<sup class='step_heading'>Preparation of Routing Parameter File</sup> <br>
<span class='step_property'> Task: </span> Execution of Routing requires river basin's grid flow direction file. In case a user has provided a vector file for stations(dams), where geometry is represented by their point location, rather than just a station-csv file, then RAT {{rat_version.major}}.{{rat_version.minor}} automatically creates the station-csv file which will be further used to creation station_xy file (in step 8) required to execute Routing.<br><br>

<span class='step_property'> Task: </span> To calculate surface area time serirs of each reservoir, a vector file of reservoirs is required where the geometry is represented by the reservoir polygons. It should also contain columns: 'dam_name_column','id' and 'area'.  In case, you just want to use step-9 and 10, values of 'dam_name_column' and 'id' can be anything but otherwise it should match with the 'name_column' and 'id_column' of the station vector file used in step-7.

!!! note
    In case step-9 is not executed before step-10 (<b>basin_reservoirs.shp</b> has not been created) and `station_global_data` is `False`, then step-10 (and step-12) runs for all reservoirs in the reservoir vector file provided by the user, assuming that all the reservoirs lie within the river basin.
