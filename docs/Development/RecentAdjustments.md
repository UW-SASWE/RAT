# Recent Adjustments

### June 30, 2024
There is a change in the required permissions for Google Service Accounts to access Earth Engine API.  

Earlier users need to give one of the following roles to service accounts:  
    * Earth Engine Resource Viewer (roles/earthengine.viewer) OR  
    * Earth Engine Resource Writer (roles/earthengine.writer) OR  
    * Earth Engine Resource Admin (roles/earthengine.admin)  

Now, an additional role is required for service accounts to access Earth Engine. That role is as follows:  
    * Service Usage Consumer (roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer)

Additionally, now it is recommended that the google cloud project itself should to be registered for use with Earth Engine. Earlier instead of the cloud project, users had to register each of their service accounts to use with Earth Engine.  

We have updated the RAT documentation accordingly [here](../../QuickStart/GettingReady/#gee-credentials) in step 4 of task 3 and task 4A has been added as an alternative to task 4B for GEE Credentials.
